                This is our second piece that we have produced. <br> 
                On this project we wanted to focus more on a motion capture aspect of it so that it could be used in different ways such as at music events and playing aorund with the interaction with the viewer. For this we were using a webcam to track only the motion of the audience infront of the camera. This allows the adience to play around with the choice of movement and no movement. immersing them more into the piece. As well as this creating a subtle background behind it that when paried can only be seen where your movement lights up.</div>
