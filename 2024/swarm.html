Our first project, "The Swarm," marked our initial exploration of art through code.
Initially developed using Python, we transitioned to TouchDesigner to exploit its advanced capabilities. 
Inspired by Craig Reynolds' Boids program, "The Swarm" is modeled using three mathematical principles: 
separation, cohesion, and alignment.
With this project, we aimed to illustrate the seamless connection between nature and technology, 
emulating the fluid movement of a flock of swallows.
Our goal is to challenge viewers' perceptions, 
prompting them to reconsider the boundaries between art and technology.

Our mission is to blend technological understanding with artistic expression, 
immersing audiences in our creations and encouraging a deeper appreciation of the technology that surrounds us.
