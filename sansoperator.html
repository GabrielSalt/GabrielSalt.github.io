            <p>My name is Jacob Beeson I am a first-year student at imperial. Through the hack starter program,  we produced a live computer-generated installation that projects unique and ever-changing silhouettes resembling a swarm. This dynamic artwork is not only visually captivating but also incorporates motion capture technology and is audio-reactive, creating an immersive and interactive experience for the audience. The constantly evolving visuals respond to the movements of viewers and ambient sounds, making each presentation of the work a singular experience.<br>
